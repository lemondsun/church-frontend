          We endeavor to encourage individuals to wholly follow the Lord in
          order to promote independent, productive influential men and women of
          God, who will in turn produce Like- Kind. <br /> We further endeavor
          to impact the unchurched in the community, nationally, and globally
          for Christ. We expect to see lives changed through prayer and personal
          appropriation of Godâ€™s word in daily living.
